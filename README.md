## Three Body Problem Simulator

"the three-body problem is the problem of taking an initial set of data that
specifies the positions, masses and velocities of three bodies for some
particular point in time and then determining the motions of the three bodies,
in accordance with the laws of classical mechanics "

#Objective
  To write a simulator that can visualize the motion of three mass (sun) in
in a universe that abstract everything else into vacuum. At time=0 (start point)
user must give all the three mass initial velocity  and position that keeps these
mass apart from collision, Although they are very likely to collide after a while.
After the collision, the mass of the two would  loss a small portion and combine,
and it will travel at the direction of the sum of vector speed times initial mass.

Further development would consider add planet(mass smaller that 1% of stars) and
spacecrafts (mass if negligible) into the system. It will be interesting to find
that the planets were wrested by these three suns and finally swollowed by one
of them. After that, it will be interesting to introducing speed of light(c)
and relativity into the system. And how interesting the gravitational lens would
be like in the chaotic system.

During the development, I may consistently improving the UI of the program and
Introducing new features like manually adjustable camera, recording the trajectory
of one of the object and print out statistics. Further more, it would be interesting
to implement a database to do that.

At last, the project will be build majorly by java. Since I only learnt Java at
first two years in college. But since I begin to learn python by my self, it is
possible to wrote something in python, and maybe more language.
Moreover, I will make mobile app for this program. And most of all， Windows Phone
at least.Proud to be 1%, Sign.
